# Portfolio-Website
A portfolio website is a curated, online space that showcases your best work. A portfolio website is generally a static website featuring work samples and other details.

This repository contains the HTML and CSS source code for my personal portfolio website. It serves as a platform to showcase my projects, skills, and experiences. The website is designed to be visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive across various devices.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio repository! I hope you find my work interesting and valuable. If you have any questions or would like to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out.
